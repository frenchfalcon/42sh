# 42sh - 2014
Bash like Shell developed during my second year of studies, in C.

This project aims to reproduce a Bash-like Shell using C on a Linux Environment.
Command line arguments are processed using a homemade Lexer, Parser (tree recursive)

Are handled :

- Native commands : ls, pwd, echo etc..
- Binary execution : ./
- Environment variables
- All |, >, >>, ;
- Signals, Ctrl-C/Ctrl-D
